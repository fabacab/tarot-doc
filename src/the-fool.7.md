# "THE FOOL" 7 "MAY 2017" "Tarot Documentation" "Tech Autonomy Manuals"

## NAME

The Fool - Tarot card with numeric value 0.

## SYNOPSIS

The fool sets out for an adventure.

## DESCRIPTION

`The Fool` begins the tarot and is filled with all the energy of the world, though without the knowledge of being filled. Instead, the energy shows itself as innocence and pure joy and the inarguable want for adventure. He stands with bindle in one hand, walking stick in the other, heading to the right on shaky ground and towards a destination we cannot see. An animal companion pushes him on from behind, urging him forward.

## IN A READING

Joy, innocence, lightness, energy without known purpose, travel. If not physical travel, then the travelling of your heart when it beats so happy right out of your chest.

## AUTHORS

Various people collectively calling themselves "Tech Autonomists."
