## NAME

The Knight of Cups 

## SYNOPSIS

The young Knight, riding relaxed towards the river on his horse, holding a cup forth.

## DESCRIPTION

`The Knight of Cups` is the poet, the artist; the self-identified fanatic Defender of the Beautiful; or at least the things he believes to be Beautiful. He is indulgent, highly fantasy-oriented; a daydreamer and a heartfelt romantic. This Knight would die for the Sublime, or else launch himself into the war trenches to live and die by Love and Friendship. Though he may not expect the same in return, likely would expect his beloveds to leave a poetically charged headstone in the wake of his inevitably untimely-heroic-beautiful death.

## IN A READING

Likely keeping Bacchus not much farther than arm's length, the Knight of Cups is brave and self-sacrificing, though can be possessive in certain ways. The biggest downfall of this Knight is his penchant for blinding himself with his own Pleasures , which leads to over-indulgence and a vulnerability to anything that remotely promises Truth and Beauty, those forces that he believes sharpen his sword. On the other hand, the Knight drinks too deeply of his pain, too, and tends to bleed his wounds egregiously, to the point where even his fight is weakened. But the Knight of Cups loves and loves truly, and so he is in return loved in by many. His cloak is stitched together with the waking from sweet dreaming. His cup is filled with thoughts that scatter like quicksilver if spilled. He he also is liable not to notice if his horse can't forge the river and starts to drown. He'd probably get too distracted writing sonnets to the color of the water to save himself.
